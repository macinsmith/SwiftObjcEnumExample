# SwiftObjcEnumExample
Example of using Swift and Objective C enums

I was looking for a simple example of accessing Objective C enums from Swift and Swift enums from Objective C and could not find a simple, complete example.  Hopefully this helps.

I compiled it with Xcode 10.3 under Swift 5

Enjoy
